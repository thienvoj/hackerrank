Sendingr request of host=10000 and the response contains 10000 fields might get into memory issue
on client browser and it will take a long time to get response back, and can harm microservice stability.

1) solution 1: pagination
The benefit of this approach is to control of returned payload size and can eliminate possible memory
issues for the client and can eliminate memory problems in microservice too,
with proper validation of pagination parameters.
If client does not use most of the 10000 fields from response, then work with backend team.
Ideally, backend support GraphQL and client can query the exact data needed from frontend.

2) Solution 2: chunking
The data is sent in response as a series of “chunks”.
Basically, elements can be sent one by one, without storing the whole response in memory and
without closing connection until every chunk is passed. This way we can send unlimited size of data
in just one request.

3) Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

With the Kinesis Client Library (KCL), we can build Kinesis Applications and use streaming data
to power real-time dashboards, generate alerts, implement dynamic pricing and advertising, and more.
